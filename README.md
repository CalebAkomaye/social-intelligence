## Overview

Insight is a platform meant to transform online conversations into actionable insights and high-quality leads. Built to leverage the power of AI and real-time data processing, it empowers businesses to identify key opportunities and close deals faster. This project is a learning-focused initiative with the goal of experimenting and showcasing the practical implementation of FastAPI, Python, and MongoDB, along with advanced AI techniques.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Social Media Monitoring**: Track relevant conversations across major platforms and forums.
2. **NLP & Sentiment Analysis**: Identify the emotions and intent behind social conversations.
3. **Buyer Intent Scoring**: Gauge the likelihood of leads making a purchase.
4. **Customizable Filters**: Tailor the system for industry-specific needs.
5. **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication for roles like sales and marketing.
6. **Seamless CRM Integration**: Export leads to platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot.
7. **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Intuitive interface for sorting and analyzing leads.
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Feedback loop to refine AI algorithms over time.

## Backend Implementation

The backend is built with **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB**, and integrates with MongoDB for data persistence. It handles:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication with email verification.
- **Data Processing**: Asynchronous data ingestion and NLP analysis using advanced AI/ML techniques.
- **API Services**: RESTful API endpoints for frontend interaction.
- **Database Design**:
  - **Leads Collection**: Stores text, sentiment scores, buyer-intent metrics, timestamps, and user labels.
  - **Users Collection**: Handles account credentials, roles, and preferences.
  - **Configuration Collection**: Maintains keyword sets, scoring rules, and other dynamic settings.
